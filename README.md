# The official implementation of S-LRTC, BS-TMac, SpBCD, EPT-BCD, MCP-BCD, and SCAD-BCD via Matlab
The implementation is based on FaLRTC, TMac, and geomCG, we thanks the authors for sharing their code
### Quickly test S-LRTC
```S-LRTC/S-LRTC.m``` is an implementation of "**A Mixture of Nuclear Norm and Matrix Factorization for Tensor Completion**", one can quickly test the algorithm by running ```test_S-LRTC.m```

### Quickly test BS-TMac
```BS-TMac/BS-TMac.m``` is an implementation of "**Robust balancing scheme-based approach for tensor completion**", one can quickly test the algorithm by running ```test_BS-TMac.m```

### Quickly test SpBCD
```SpBCD/Sp_BCD.m``` is an implementation of "**Robust Schatten-p Norm Based Approach for Tensor Completion**", one can quickly test the algorithm by running ```test_SpBCD.m```

### Quickly test EPT-BCD, MCP-BCD, and SCAD-BCD
```EPT-BCD/EPT_BCD.m```, ```MCP-BCD/MCP_BCD.m```, and ```SCAD-BCD/SCAD_BCD.m``` is the implementation of "**Robust approximations of low-rank minimization for tensor completion**", one can quickly test the algorithms by running ```test_EPT_MCP_SCAD.m```
